    <div class="sub" id="h_1">PWS Drone: When I was 16/17, I designed and created a DIY drone with a friend as an end project for high school. PWS stands for Profielwerkstuk, which is Dutch for profile piece. We designed our own frame and conducted our own research. We also created a website as a manual for assembling the drone. The drone flies very well, and I am proud to say that I made it.

    <div class="sub" id="h_2">Slidify: Remember the Spotify car thing? It has stopped producing now, so I took that exact concept and added a mechanical slider to have control over the time left on a song, and the slider slides as the song progresses. Unfortunately, this was just a concept of mine that I didn't pursue making. Luckily, a good friend of mine decided to pick up the project and really think about how it should work. He is currently working on it, and I hope it turns out well!

    <div class="sub" id="h_3">Pictures from Croatia: I took these pictures on the coast of Croatia using my Mavic Mini 2 to capture the aerial shots, and I'm quite happy with how they turned out. These pictures are just some fillers.

    <div class="sub" id="h_4">Portfolio website: I have made dozens of websites before this one, but none of them feel as good as this one. This website is meant as a portfolio for myself. I have had countless designs before this one, but this is the final version, I think..

    <div class="sub" id="h_5">Warchild animation: The first team-based project I ever did was when I was 13. We were supposed to make an animation for War Child. We decided to do it in Blender because that was the only thing we kind of knew. The animations were really wonky and the graphics were not realistic, but I think it was more the message behind it that mattered. I am proud of what I made many years ago.

    <div class="sub" id="h_7">DOOM MULTIPLAYER: I was really obsessed with Doom Ultimate and its graphics. I wanted to recreate Doom Ultimate as an arena multiplayer shooter so that I could show off my skills to my friends. I remade the movement and shooting mechanics really well but had to settle for an AI opponent because multiplayer was too difficult at the time. Unfortunately, I lost all the content from the game, so I can't show any pictures.

    <div class="sub" id="h_8">Space Shooter: To introduce myself to the Unity game engine, I followed a lot of tutorials. One of them was the Space Shooter tutorial by Unity (https://learn.unity.com/project/space-shooter-tutorial). The game was fun to make and fun to play, and it was the first game that I was truly proud of.

    <div class="sub" id="h_9">MO Blender Game: In a game jam, my friend and I decided to use the Blender game engine for the first time. The game idea was to take MO from Wall-e and make him the player character. Your task was to clean an airship and deposit trash in a trash bin, but of course, you had limited storage. The 3D modeling part of the game went well, but the Blender game engine was not successful.
